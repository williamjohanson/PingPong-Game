Overview: 
A ping pong style game where each player has their own board on their own device. The aim of the game is to hit the ball 
into places where your opponent will let the board miss the ball and in that case, you win!


Instructions:
As soon as the game is compiled and run on each respective device, the successful initialisation message "PRESS JOYSTICK" 
is displayed.
Once both boards are ready, one player can proceed and press the joystick. This will mean it is there turn to serve. Once 
a player has served the game is on!
Each player has the ability to move their own board left and right, and each board takes up 3 of the 7 available spaces 
in the farthest column. The ball will bounce off differently from the board dependent on where the ball strikes the board.

LEFT: The ball will bounce off 45 degrees to the left.
CENTER: The ball bounces straight back.
RIGHT: The ball bounces off 45 degrees to the right.

If the ball misses the board entirely you lose! Once this occurs a message will be displayed showing who has won and who 
has lost until the game is restarted.

The game can be restarted by pressing the joystick.



If you lose IR connectivity, make sure you bring the boards back closer together and restart the game again by pressing
the joystick.
